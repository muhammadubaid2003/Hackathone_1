# AI-Robot Brain Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) module.

## A

**Autonomous Navigation** - The capability of a robot to move through an environment without human intervention, using sensors and algorithms to avoid obstacles and reach goals.

## B

**Balance Controller** - A control system that maintains a humanoid robot's stability during locomotion by adjusting its center of mass within the support polygon.

**Bipedal Locomotion** - The act of walking on two legs, which requires special control algorithms to maintain balance and stability.

## C

**Center of Mass (CoM)** - The point in a robot where the total mass is concentrated, critical for balance and stability in humanoid robots.

**Computer Vision** - A field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world, used extensively in robot perception.

## D

**Deep Learning** - A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

**Differential Drive** - A common wheel configuration for robots that uses two wheels independently driven to achieve motion and steering.

## F

**Footstep Planning** - The process of determining where and when to place feet during humanoid locomotion to maintain stability and balance.

## H

**Hardware Acceleration** - The use of specialized hardware (like GPUs) to perform computations more efficiently than general-purpose processors.

**Humanoid Robot** - A robot designed with a human-like body structure, typically having a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

**Isaac Sim** - NVIDIA's photorealistic simulation application for developing, testing, and validating AI-based robotics applications.

**Isaac ROS** - A collection of high-performance, hardware-accelerated packages that bridge NVIDIA's GPU computing capabilities with the Robot Operating System.

**Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** - A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

## K

**Kinematics** - The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion.

## L

**LiDAR** - Light Detection and Ranging, a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances.

**Localization** - The process of determining a robot's position and orientation within a given coordinate system.

## M

**Mapping** - The process of creating a representation of the environment based on sensor data.

**Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)** - A probabilistic algorithm for robot self-localization that uses particle filters.

## N

**Navigation2 (Nav2)** - The next-generation navigation framework for ROS 2, designed to provide safe, reliable, and efficient navigation for mobile robots.

## O

**Obstacle Avoidance** - The capability of a robot to detect and avoid obstacles in its path while navigating toward a goal.

**Occupancy Grid** - A probabilistic 2D representation of space that divides the world into discrete cells that are marked as occupied, free, or unknown.

## P

**Path Planning** - The process of determining a geometric path from a start point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles.

**Perception Pipeline** - A sequence of processing steps that transform raw sensor data into meaningful information about the environment.

**Point Cloud** - A collection of data points in a three-dimensional coordinate system, representing the external surface of an object or environment.

## R

**Robot Operating System (ROS)** - A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions.

**ROS 2** - The second generation of the Robot Operating System, designed for production environments with improved security and real-time capabilities.

## S

**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** - The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

**Support Polygon** - The area encompassed by a humanoid robot's feet that must contain the center of mass to maintain balance.

**Synthetic Data** - Artificially generated data that mimics real-world data, often used for training AI models when real data is scarce.

## V

**Visual SLAM (VSLAM)** - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping that uses visual input (cameras) as the primary sensor modality.

**Voxel** - A volume element, representing a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space, commonly used in 3D mapping.
