# ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Nervous System module! This comprehensive guide will introduce you to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the core nervous system of humanoid robots, enabling seamless communication, control, and embodiment by connecting AI agents to physical actuators and sensors.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters that build upon each other to provide you with a complete understanding of ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics:

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System](./introduction.md)
- What ROS 2 is and why it matters for Physical AI
- Core concepts: nodes, topics, services, and messages
- How data flows inside a humanoid robot system
- Code examples demonstrating fundamental concepts

### [Chapter 2: Controlling Robots with ROS 2 and Python Agents](./python-agents.md)
- Using rclpy to build ROS 2 nodes
- Publishing and subscribing to topics
- Bridging AI logic with robot controllers
- Practical examples and troubleshooting guidance

### [Chapter 3: Modeling the Humanoid Body with URDF](./urdf-modeling.md)
- Purpose of URDF in humanoid robotics
- Links, joints, sensors, and actuators
- How URDF enables simulation and control consistency
- Preparing robot models for Gazebo and Isaac simulation environments

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters in order as each builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous one. However, if you already have experience with ROS 2 fundamentals, you may jump to specific chapters that address your current needs.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and software engineering students transitioning into Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Whether you're completely new to ROS 2 or looking to understand its application in humanoid robotics, this module provides the knowledge and practical skills you need.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful for ROS 2 development)

## Hands-On Practice

Each chapter includes exercises and practical examples to reinforce your learning. We strongly encourage you to work through these exercises to gain practical experience with ROS 2 concepts.

Let's begin your journey into understanding how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots!
