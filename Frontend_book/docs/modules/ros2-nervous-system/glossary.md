# ROS 2 Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the ROS 2 Nervous System module.

## A

**Action** - A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks with feedback and status updates.

**AI Agent** - A software entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve goals, often integrated with robot controllers in ROS 2 systems.

## B

**Bridge** - A connection between different communication frameworks, such as between ROS 2 and external systems.

## C

**Controller** - A node or system that sends commands to robot actuators to achieve desired behaviors.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)** - The underlying middleware that provides the communication infrastructure for ROS 2.

## G

**Gazebo** - A physics-based 3D simulation environment often used with ROS 2 for robot simulation and testing.

## I

**Interface** - The definition of messages, services, or actions that enable communication between ROS 2 nodes.

**Isaac** - NVIDIA's robotics platform that can integrate with ROS 2 for simulation and deployment.

## J

**Joint** - In URDF, the connection between two links that allows relative motion.

## L

**Link** - In URDF, a rigid body element that represents a part of the robot.

## M

**Message** - The data structure used for communication between nodes in ROS 2, published on topics.

## N

**Node** - A process that performs computation in ROS 2; the basic unit of execution.

## P

**Publisher** - A node that sends messages to a topic.

## Q

**QoS (Quality of Service)** - Settings that define the behavior of message delivery in terms of reliability, durability, and other properties.

## S

**Service** - A synchronous request/response communication pattern in ROS 2.

**Subscriber** - A node that receives messages from a topic.

## T

**Topic** - A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in a publish/subscribe pattern.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** - An XML-based format for representing robot models in ROS.

## R

**rclpy** - The Python client library for ROS 2, enabling Python-based node development.

**Robot State Publisher** - A ROS 2 node that publishes TF transforms based on joint states and URDF models.
