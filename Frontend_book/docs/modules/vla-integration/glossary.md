# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Vision-Language-Action Integration module.

## A

**Action Space** - The set of all possible actions that a robot can execute in its environment.

**Affordance** - The possibility of an action that an object or environment provides to an agent; e.g., a handle affords grasping.

**Autonomous System** - A system that can operate independently, making decisions and executing actions without continuous human input.

## C

**Cognitive Architecture** - The structural organization of an AI system that enables perception, reasoning, planning, and action.

**Command Parsing** - The process of analyzing a natural language command to extract its semantic meaning and intended action.

**Context Awareness** - The ability of a system to understand and utilize information about its environment and situation.

## D

**Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** - A type of machine learning that combines deep learning with reinforcement learning to learn complex behaviors.

**Digital Twin** - A virtual replica of a physical robot or system that mirrors its real-world counterpart.

## E

**Embodied AI** - Artificial intelligence that is integrated with a physical robot, allowing it to interact with the real world.

**End-to-End Learning** - Training a system to perform a complete task without intermediate hand-designed components.

## G

**Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)** - A type of large language model that uses transformer architecture for natural language understanding and generation.

**Grounded Language Understanding** - Understanding language in the context of physical objects and actions in the environment.

## H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** - The study of interactions between humans and robots, including communication, collaboration, and trust.

## I

**Instruction Following** - The ability of a system to execute actions based on natural language commands.

**Intention Inference** - The process of deducing a human's intended goal from their actions or commands.

## L

**Large Language Model (LLM)** - A sophisticated neural network trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language.

**Language-Conditioned Policy** - A robot control policy that takes natural language as input to guide its actions.

**Latent Space** - An abstract, lower-dimensional space where high-dimensional data (like images) are represented.

## M

**Manipulation Planning** - Planning the sequence of movements required to manipulate objects in the environment.

**Multimodal Learning** - Learning that incorporates multiple types of sensory input (e.g., vision, language, touch).

## N

**Neural-Symbolic Integration** - Combining neural networks (for perception and learning) with symbolic reasoning (for planning and logic).

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - A field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand and generate human language.

## P

**Perception-Action Coupling** - The tight integration between sensory perception and motor action in intelligent systems.

**Physical Reasoning** - Understanding and predicting how physical objects and forces interact in the real world.

**Prompt Engineering** - The practice of designing effective inputs for large language models to produce desired outputs.

## R

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** - Training AI systems using feedback from human demonstrations or evaluations.

**Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)** - A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, and communication infrastructure.

**ROS 2 Action Architecture** - The ROS 2 framework for handling long-running tasks with feedback and status updates.

## S

**Situated Action** - Actions that are contextually appropriate based on the current environment and situation.

**Spatial Reasoning** - The ability to understand and reason about objects in space and their relationships.

**Structured Representations** - Organized, interpretable representations of information (e.g., object properties, spatial relations).

## T

**Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)** - Planning that jointly considers high-level task planning and low-level motion planning.

**Theory of Mind** - The ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents, desires) to others.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Model** - A model that integrates visual perception, language understanding, and action generation.

**Vision Transformers (ViT)** - A type of neural network architecture that applies transformer mechanisms to visual data.

**Visuomotor Control** - Control systems that directly map visual input to motor actions.

## W

**Whisper** - OpenAI's automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that converts speech to text.

**World Model** - An internal representation of the environment that an agent uses for planning and decision-making.
