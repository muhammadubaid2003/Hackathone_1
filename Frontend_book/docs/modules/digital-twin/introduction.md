# Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin module! This comprehensive guide will teach you physics-based simulation and digital twin technologies for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity, designed for AI and robotics students building simulated humanoid environments.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters that build upon each other to provide you with a complete understanding of digital twin technology for robotics:

### [Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo.md)
- Gravity, collisions, joints, and dynamics
- Running humanoid robots in simulated worlds
- Configuring realistic physics parameters

### [Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity](./high-fidelity-unity.md)
- Visual realism and human-robot interaction
- Syncing robot state with simulated environments
- Creating immersive digital twin experiences

### [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation for Perception](./sensor-simulation.md)
- LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Sensor data pipelines for AI systems
- Creating realistic perception data

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters in order as each builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous one. The module starts with physics simulation fundamentals, moves to high-fidelity visualization, and concludes with realistic sensor simulation that ties everything together.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and robotics students who want to build simulated humanoid environments. Whether you're completely new to digital twin concepts or looking to understand advanced simulation techniques, this module provides the knowledge and practical skills you need.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Basic programming knowledge (Python and/or C#)

## Hands-On Practice

Each chapter includes exercises and practical examples to reinforce your learning. We strongly encourage you to work through these exercises to gain practical experience with digital twin technologies.

Let's begin your journey into understanding how to create realistic digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity!
