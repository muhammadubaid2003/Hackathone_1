# Digital Twin Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Digital Twin module.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)** - A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

**Articulated Robot** - A robot with rotary joints, similar to a human arm, allowing complex movement patterns.

## B

**Bidirectional Communication** - Communication that flows in both directions between systems.

## C

**Collision Detection** - The computational problem of detecting when two or more objects come into contact.

**Coordinate Frame** - A system for assigning coordinates to points in space, used to define positions and orientations.

## D

**Digital Twin** - A virtual representation of a physical object or system that enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and optimization.

**Depth Camera** - A camera that captures distance information for every pixel in an image, creating 3D point cloud data.

## G

**Gazebo** - A physics-based 3D simulation environment primarily used for robotics applications.

## H

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** - The study of interactions between humans and robots.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** - An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

**Inertial Frame** - A reference frame in which the laws of physics take their simplest form.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)** - A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances.

## P

**PBR (Physically-Based Rendering)** - A shading and rendering approach that simulates light in a way that more closely matches how light behaves in the real world.

**Perception Pipeline** - A sequence of processing steps that transform raw sensor data into meaningful information about the environment.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)** - A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions.

**ROS Bridge** - A protocol and implementation that enables communication between ROS-based systems and non-ROS systems.

## S

**Sensor Fusion** - The process of combining data from multiple sensors to improve the accuracy and reliability of information.

**Simulation** - The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.

**Synchronization** - The coordination of events to operate in harmony.

## U

**Unity** - A cross-platform game engine that can be used for creating simulations and digital twin applications.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** - An XML format for representing a robot model.

## V

**Virtual Reality (VR)** - A simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.

**Visualization** - The process of creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate information.
